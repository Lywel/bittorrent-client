2.3.1

When a peer wants to transfer a file it contacts the tracker.
The tracker returns a list of the peers currently trasnferring the file
as a bencoded dicts.

Three fields in dict : peer id, ip, port.
The list length in bytes < n * (23 + 259 + 7)

If the client precised compact=1 then each peer should be reprensented as a
bencoded string on 6 bytes : 4 bytes ipv4 address + 2 bytes port number
<= encoded with network byte order

fd = 
  bind(fd, addr)
  listen(fd)

while (client = accept(fd))
  fork()
  read/write(client)
  close(client)
